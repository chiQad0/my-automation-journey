# My Automation Journey

This repository contains Python automation scripts I build as part of my learning journey. Each script focuses on automating everyday tasks using Python’s standard libraries, especially `pathlib`, to develop practical skills step by step.

---

## Repository Purpose

- Track my progress in automation development  
- Practice writing clean, reusable Python code  
- Build a portfolio of automation projects to share with peers and potential employers  
- Document my learning path with organized scripts and explanations  

---

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized by day or topic to keep scripts focused and manageable.

Example structure:
```
day_1_get_name/
day_2_file_reading/
day_3_file_system/
```

Each folder contains scripts relevant to that topic.

---

## How to Use

1. Clone or download this repository.  
2. Navigate to the folder of the script you want to run.  
3. Run the Python script using Python 3.x: (Note: Make sure Python 3.x is installed and available in your terminal.)

```bash
python script_name.py
```

## Scripts Included

- Day 1: Basic input and file writing (get user name and save it)

- Day 2: File reading and simple text analysis

- Day 3: File system automation with pathlib (detect file extensions, list files/folders)

- More scripts will be added as I progress.

## Learning Goals

- Master Python file handling and automation

- Understand and apply pathlib for real-world tasks

- Build automation scripts that save time and reduce manual work
---

## Future Plans

- Add argument parsing for dynamic folder selection

- Create scripts that move and organize files automatically

- Develop small GUI tools for easier interaction

- Explore automation beyond file systems
